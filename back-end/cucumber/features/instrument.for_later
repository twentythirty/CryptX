Feature: Instrument

    I have the ability to add instruments and map them to exchanges

    Background:
    
        Given the system has an Compliance Manager

    Scenario: New Instrument Exchange Mapping

        Given there is an Instrument that can be Mapped to Bitfinex
        When I log onto CryptX as Compliance Manager
        And I have selected an Instrument to map
        And I find a matching external identifier for the selected Instrument from Bitfinex
        And I create a new Exchange Mapping with my selections
        Then the new Mapping is saved to the database
        But I can only have one Instrument Mapping for each Exchange per Instrument

    Scenario: View Instrument and it`s Mappings

        Given the system has Instrument Mappings for Binance
        And the system has Instrument Mappings for Bitfinex
        And the system has updated the Instrument Market Data
        And the system has Instrument Liquidity History for the last 7 days
        When I log onto CryptX as Compliance Manager
        And I find an Instrument that has Mappings
        And I retrieve the Instrument information
        And I retrieve the Instrument Exchange Mappings related to it
        Then the Instrument information should indidicate the amount of Exchanges connected
        And the Instrument Exchange Mappings their current price, last day and week volumes
